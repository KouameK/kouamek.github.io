<h4 align="center">INGREDIENTS</h4>
<ol class="place center">
  <li>Bag of Attieke (about 1lb)</li>
  <li>Tablespoon Vinegar</li>
  <li>Maggi (or stock cubes)</li>
  <li>Tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ol>
<h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
<ol class="place">
  <li>

    Place the attiéké in a metal bowl then place in a steamer basket and steam until all the water has been absorbed</li>
  <li>Now remove from the steamer and work the attiéké with a fork to break up any clumps.</li>
  <li>Return to the steamer and cook for about 10 minutes more</li>
  <li>
    Turn the attiéké into a bowl and work with a fork to break up all the clumps (if the clumps do not break up, then it has not cooked enough.</li>
  <li>Steam for a further 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Continue with this process until the attiéké is fluffy and cooked but not sloppy (it should look like couscous or grits</li>
  <li>Once it is done, turn into a large bowl and work in the vinegar, crumbled Maggi cubes and olive oil. To serve, turn the attiéké onto a dish and garnish with a little diced tomato and thin slivers of sliced onion.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where can you find it </h2>
<p>In Abidjan, Attiéké is served everywhere, with just about everything–from grilled chicken to smoked fish–and is seriously addictive.<br> As a result, attiéké is eaten by everyone, regardless of region or nation of origin. <br> It is sold pre-steamed in
  the local markets in portion-sized bags for 100 CFA (about 20 US cents), making attiéké an affordable and filling staple food.<br> Although attiéké is still a unique, local product, it is now widely available at African markets in Europe and the US,
  where it is sold in either frozen or dehydrated form. It is easily steamed with a bit of water in the microwave and enjoyed–preferably with a delicious kedjenou (the Ivorian national dish) or Poulet Braisé.<br> So, next time you feel like trying something
  different, head down to your local African market and buy some attiéké. <br> Your dining companions are sure to thank you and you will be supporting Ivory Coast’s female entrepreneurs.
</p>
<h2>What difference will it make?</h2>
<p>The ivoran government is asking the African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation to protect Attieke.<br> But ARIPO does not have a compliance policing unit <br>so it's clear how it would be enforced on the continent ,let alone elsewhere.<br>Given
  that markets in Ivory Coast and elsewhere in West Africa are full of pirated of music and DVDs.<br>It's hard to see anyone going round to inspect bags of attieke and confiscated any that are not certified.</p>
